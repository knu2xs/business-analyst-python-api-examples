Business Analyst Python API Examples
============================================================================================================

Recently, the development team working on Business Analyst has put significant resources into improving the 
functionality of Business Analyst through Python, specifically the Python API for ArcGIS, the ``arcgis`` 
package. This `repository`_ contains examples of how this functionality can be used. 

.. note::

   While the included examples all ran for me, and likely can provide a useful template for you to 
   start tackling similar projects, absolutely no guarantees are made. That said, there is a high likelihood
   you may find some useful nuggets in here if you work with Business Analyst and Python.
