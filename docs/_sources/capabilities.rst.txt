Capabilities and Functionality
==============================

Currently we have an aggressive list of capabilities we want to include, but only
so many hours in the day. Still, we want to share a few useufl examples of how to
use what is avilable today (*current*), what is coming soon (*next*),
and offer a glimpse into ideas we may be working on (*future*).

To clarify a bit, *current* capabilities are things you can do today. 
*Next* capabilities are either in the development master branch or are actively 
being reviewed as a pull request, things you can reasonably expect to see in the next 
release. *Future* includes functionality we are actively working on, and 
likely is in some working state, but emphatically not ready for release, yet.
